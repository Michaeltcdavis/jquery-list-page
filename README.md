# List Component with JQuery

This component uses JQuery to create a list page prototype that does not persist on reload.

Click on a list item to edit the item and a new empty item will appear below the edited item.
Selecting an item other than the newly created blank line will remove the blank line.
editing the new blank line will create another blank line below that.
The blank line at the bottom of the list will always be available for editing, and if it is edited, a new blank line will be created below.

## Running the Script

Ensure the file structure doesn't change and open index.html in a browser.

For this task I referenced projects I have completed in the past including:

I also used the JQuery API for JQuery docs for functions I haven't used yet.
